# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Initialization**: Setting up the initial structure and documentation for the React Todo application, including the creation of the `memory-bank` directory and core files.
- **Component Design**: Designing and implementing reusable React components for the todo application, such as `AddTodo.jsx`, `ThemeToggle.jsx`, `TodoFilter.jsx`, `TodoItem.jsx`, `TodoList.jsx`, and `TodoSummary.jsx`.
- **State Management**: Implementing the Context API to manage global state, including `TodoContext.jsx` and `ThemeContext.jsx`.
- **Styling**: Applying Tailwind CSS utilities to ensure consistent and responsive styling across the application.

## Recent Changes
- Created the `memory-bank` directory and initialized core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Set up the initial React application structure using Vite.
- Implemented the `TodoContext.jsx` and `ThemeContext.jsx` for state management.
- Created the initial React components: `AddTodo.jsx`, `ThemeToggle.jsx`, `TodoFilter.jsx`, `TodoItem.jsx`, `TodoList.jsx`, and `TodoSummary.jsx`.
- Applied Tailwind CSS utilities to the components for styling.

## Next Steps
- Populate `activeContext.md` with details about the current work focus and recent changes.
- Populate `progress.md` with an overview of what has been completed and what remains to be built.
- Implement the main application logic in `App.jsx` and `main.jsx`.
- Ensure the application is responsive and accessible by following best practices for web accessibility.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Architecture**: Decided to use a modular architecture with React components and the Context API for state management.
- **Build Tool**: Chose Vite for its fast development server and efficient build process.
- **Styling**: Chose Tailwind CSS for its utility-first approach, which allows for rapid development and consistent styling.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring the application is accessible by following best practices for web accessibility.
