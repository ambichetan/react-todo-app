# Progress

## What Works
- Initialized the `memory-bank` directory.
- Created and populated core files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md`.
- Set up the initial React application structure using Vite.
- Implemented the `TodoContext.jsx` and `ThemeContext.jsx` for state management.
- Created the initial React components: `AddTodo.jsx`, `ThemeToggle.jsx`, `TodoFilter.jsx`, `TodoItem.jsx`, `TodoList.jsx`, and `TodoSummary.jsx`.
- Applied Tailwind CSS utilities to the components for styling.

## What's Left to Build
- Implement the main application logic in `App.jsx` and `main.jsx`.
- Ensure the application is responsive and accessible by following best practices for web accessibility.
- Write tests for the application.
- Document the code and any additional context as needed.

## Current Status
- The initial setup and documentation are complete.
- The application structure is in place, and the core files are populated with relevant information.
- The initial components and state management are implemented.

## Known Issues
- None identified at this time.
